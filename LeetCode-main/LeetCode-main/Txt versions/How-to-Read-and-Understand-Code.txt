1. Identify Variables: Locate all the variables used in the code.
2. Divide the Code: Break the code into smaller sections, such as functions, loops, and conditionals.
3. Follow Input and Output Flow: Carefully track how the initial input data is processed and transformed into the final output data. 
4. Analyze Control Flow: Examine and determine the precise sequence in which different parts of the code are executed.
5. Find Conditional Statements: Identify if, else, or switch statements, and analyze how they influence the program's decision-making process.
6. Identify Loops: Recognize loops and discern their behavior, specifically how they iterate through the code.
7. Search for Algorithms: Look for common algorithms or patterns used within the code.
8. Experiment with Code: Test the code with various inputs to observe how it behaves under different scenarios.
9. Comment: Comment on top of each substantial "block", saying what that block does.
10. [Optional] Review Online Resources: If necessary, search for explanations or discussions online to gain additional insights.
11. Recreate the Code: Strengthen your understanding by attempting to write the code from scratch based on your comprehension.
